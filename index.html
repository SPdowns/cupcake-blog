    <h2>Day One</h2>
      <p>I just came back from my first lecture and I can only describe it with the following two words.. <span class="bam">Life changing</span>. What an incredible world that until today was unbeknownst to me. The sheer vastness of the lore around this delicious little morsels is just incredible. Our professor has mastered the art of lecturing with not one but <span class="bam">TWO</span> cupcakes in her mouth, eloquently cheeked like a hamster preparing for the long winter ahead.

    <h2>Day Two</h2>
      <p>Our professor today taught the history of 350ºF. They said they always start the semesters with this lesson so as to ensure we start to understand it at the end of the course. 350ºF is the essential tempurature for every cupcake to become their best cake. Starting in 2000 B.C. in ancient Greece when they would produce a nut cake, they new 350ºF was how to make these cakes. Hopefully, we will appriciate this tempurate for all its done so we can enjoy our most precious cupcakes today.
